I work as an Assistant Professor at Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Kerala. Prior to that, I was hosted as a Post Doctoral Research Associate by [Prof. Matthew Blaschko](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mblaschk/)  at [Department of Electrical Engineering KU Leuven Belgium](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) in collaboration with [FORD Innovation and Research Centre Germany](https://www.ford.de/) and [USA](https://www.ford.com/). Prior to that, I was working at [Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology Muvattupuzha, Kerala, India](https://vjcet.org/#/).  
<br/><br/>
Before that, I received my PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), advised by [Prof. Sumana Gupta](http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/people/fac-pages/sumana.shtml) and [Prof. K. S. Venkatesh](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/). My Ph.D. thesis was entitled “Perceptual Attributes in Video Summarization”, where I worked on summarizing videos based on the human visual perspective. I received my M.Tech. Degree in Communication Engineering from [National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Sumam David](https://sumam.nitk.ac.in/), and the B.E. (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Rajasthan University Jaipur](https://www.uniraj.ac.in/).


During postdoc, I worked on designing front suspension for Mac-Pherson Architecture and studied the behaviour of massive stars in space using Bayesian Optimization.

My interest lies in Bayesian Optimization for industrial applications, computer vision and multimedia signal processing.
