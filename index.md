I am hosted by Prof. François Baccelli. Before, I was a Simons postdoctoral fellow with him at the University of Texas at Austin, Texas, USA and a postdoctoral research associate with Prof. Martin Haenggi at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA. Prior to that, I received my PhD in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, where I was advised by Prof. Adrish Banerjee. 


I received the B.E. (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Rajasthan University Jaipur](https://www.uniraj.ac.in/)
 and the M.Tech. Degree in Communication Engineering from [National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), and the PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/). My Ph.D. thesis was entitled “Perceptual Attributes in Video Summarization”, where I worked on summarizing videos based on the human visual perspective.
I was working at [Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology Muvattupuzha](https://vjcet.org/#/) and then worked as a Post Doctoral Research Associate with [Department of Electrical Engineering KU Leuven Belgium] (https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00102337) in collaboration with [FORD Innovation and Research Centre Germany](https://www.ford.de/) and USA. During postdoc, I worked on designing front suspension for Mac-Pherson Architecture and studied the behaviour of massive stars in space using Bayesian Optimization.

My interest lies in Bayesian Optimization for industrial applications, computer vision and multimedia signal processing.
